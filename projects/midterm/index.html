    <p class="lead">We asked thousands of people whether they recognized
        hit songs from the ’90s, such as <span style="color:#116AB3; font-weight:bold;">“Wannabe”</span>and<span
            style="color:#AD1A64;">“No
            Scrubs”</span>, ordering the results by birth year.</p>

    <p>Which song is more likely to be recognized by future
        generations?</p>
    <h1>Defining the ’90s Music Canon</h1>
    <p>Story by Matt Daniels, Data+Code by Ilia Blinderman,
        <em>Published: July 2020</em>
    </p>
    <!-- /// -->
    <p>Measuring music’s popularity has always been contained to a
        certain period of time: peak chart ranking, awards, opening-week
        sales—a song’s performance at its prime.</p>
    <p>But for me, it’s equally important to quantify how music is passed
        down from generation to generation, parent to teen. In 2020, we’re
        amid that critical juncture for ’90s music—we can finally start
        asking today’s teens, “What music do you recognize from the
        ’90s?”</p>
    <p>The answer will indicate how future generations will characterize
        the decade. I always believed <b>“No Diggity”</b> by Blackstreet
        would be a ’90s standard, uniting the old and young crowds at
        weddings of
        the 2050s. And to test this belief, I used 3 million data points that
        I collected via a <a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/04/music-challenge/" target="_blank">music quiz</a>, which
        asked readers
        if they recognized thousands of songs that charted on the Billboard
        Hot 100. </p>
    <p class="chart-hed">Millennials know <span>“No Diggity.”</span> But
        Gen Z? Maybe half of them, at
        best.</p>
    <p class="chart-subhed">Percent of people who recognize a clip of “No
        Diggity,” by birth year</p>
    <!-- img: 02-nodiggity -->
    <p>Sinatra, Elvis, and Chuck Berry are emblematic of ’50s music, but
        what’s the ’90s equivalent? Using the recognition data we collected,
        we can begin to define the canon. These will be the artists and songs
        that Gen Z and beyond seem to recognize (and value) among all the
        musical output from the decade.</p>
    <p>First, it’s important to understand the general trends in the
        data. <b>“No Diggity”</b> knowledge peaks among people born in 1983,
        who were 13 years old when the track debuted in 1996. We also see a
        slow drop off among people who were not fully sentient when <b>“No
            Diggity”</b> was in its prime, individuals who were 5 years old or
        younger (or not born yet) in 1996.</p>
    <p>That drop-off rate between generations—in this case, Millennials
        to Gen Z—is one indicator for whether <b>“No Diggity”</b> is
        surviving the test of time. </p>
    <p>To make this a bit easier to read, we’ll chart a person’s age at
        the time of a song’s release, rather than birth year. For songs to be
        passed to down, generation to generation, we’d expect a slower decay
        rate—evidence that they’re part of the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/the-universal-decay-of-c
ollective-memory-and-attention/" target="_blank">collective memory.</a></p>
    <p>Let’s look at another example from the mid-nineties: <b>“The
            Sign”</b> by Ace of Base.</p>
    <p class="chart-hed">Similar to <b>“No Diggity,”</b> notice the
        decline in knowledge of <span>“The Sign”</span> among people who were
        5 years old when it was released in 1993.</p>
    <p class="chart-subhed">Recognition of <b>“The Sign”</b> by age in
        1993, the year it debuted</p>
    <!-- img: 03-thesign -->
    <p>Only half of readers currently in their teens recognized “The
        Sign.” The trend here is that music has a natural half-life. Find
        someone 10 to 15 years your junior, and the likelihood that they’ll
        know your childhood music references is lower than you think.</p>
    <p>How much lower?</p>
    <p>Song knowledge erodes with each passing year. This is why I
        shouldn’t be shocked that my Gen Z colleague has never heard <b>“The
            Sign,”</b> or that teens are filming themselves listening to
        <b>“Bohemian Rhapsody”</b> for the first time. This is a normal part
        of the aging process for music.
    </p>
    <p>If you take any present-day hit that’s culturally pervasive, such
        as <b>“Old Town Road”</b> or <b>“Despacito,”</b> we’d expect that
        someone born today, in 2020, will probably not recognize it twenty
        years from now. In short, there’s a good chance they’ll interpret
        your karaoking of Lizzo, Drake, or the Jonas Brothers in 2040 as an
        obscure act.</p>
    <p>There are some especially sobering examples of this decay.</p>
    <p class="chart-hed">The 1999 hit “Wild Wild West” by Will Smith has
        lower-than-expected recognition among Gen
        Z. <span>These songs</span> are fading at an accelerated rate. </p>

    <!-- img: block1-backstreet -->
    <!-- // -->
    <p>In 1999, <b>“Wild Wild West”</b> was the song of the summer. Yet
        it is fading far faster than any other ’90s hit with comparable
        starting popularity. Twenty years ago, it was inescapable. Maybe
        Millennials are still too sick of it, even for nostalgia rotation.
        Perhaps it wasn’t even that great of a song to begin with,
        artificially inflated by Smith’s celebrity and cross-promotion with
        the film Wild Wild West.</p>
    <p><b>“Quit Playing Games”</b> is the Backstreet Boys’
        fastest-decaying hit (<b>“Everybody”</b> is the opposite,
        known by 97% of Millennials and 86% of Gen Z). I’m not sure where a
        love ballad like <b>“Quit Playing Games”</b> fits in 2020, but I was
        definitely surprised by how few Gen Zers know it. Same thing for
        J.Lo’s <b>“If You Had My Love,”</b> though there are far better songs
        from her oeuvre—she didn’t even perform it at the Super Bowl. </p>
    <p>Other songs, meanwhile, remain unusually resilient and have
        higher-than-expected universal recognition. </p>
    <p class="chart-hed">These are <span>candidate songs for the ’90s
            canon</span> and have yet to fade from culture.</p>
    <!-- /// →
<!-- chart block -->
    <p><b>I Will Always Love You</b>, Whitney Houston, 1992</p>

    <!-- img: block2-pain -->
    <p><b>Gangsta's Paradise</b>, Coolio, 1995</p>
    <!-- img: block2-coolio -->
    <!-- // -->
    <p>Why have these songs transcended generations? There’s no unifying
        theory. <b>“Jump Around”</b> still gets airplay during timeouts at
        sporting events. <b>“Macarena”</b> is still a bar mitzvah mainstay.
        <b>“I Will Always Love You”</b> is Whitney Houston’s magnum opus (or
        perhaps it’s Dolly Parton’s resurgence). While there are countless
        reasons for a song to stay culturally relevant, its staying power is
        not merely a function of its popularity in the year of release.
    </p>
    <p>There’s another fascinating cut of this data: songs that are
        generational markers, which are approaching zero recognition by Gen
        Z.</p>
    <p class="chart-hed">K-Ci and JoJo’s <span>“All My Life”</span> and
        Jewel’s <span>“You Were Meant For Me”</span> are widely known by
        Millennials, but <span>rarely recognized by anyone else.</span></p>
    <!-- /// -->
    <!-- chart block -->
    <p><b>Creep</b>, TLC, 1995</p>
    <!-- img: block3-tlc →

<p><b>Tha Crossroads</b>, Bone Thugs N Harmony, 1996</p>
<!-- img: block3-bonethugs -->
    <!-- // -->
    <p>It seems sacreligious to think that future generations will not
        know the significance of <b>“All My Life”.</b> It’s disconcerting to
        think that the markers of my childhood, what was culturally
        ubiquitous, will, in a couple of decades, be lost to time. There will
        be a moment when I can, incredibly, play it for someone and they’ll
        hear it for the first time.</p>
    <p>Maybe they’ll think it’s “good music.” That does seem to be the
        story of every generation: my parents went through the same
        existential shock when my knowledge of the ’70s was spottier than
        they expected. </p>
    <p>Every parent makes a mental note of music they’ll pass down to
        their children—records that they hope will shape their children’s
        taste and barometer for quality. That process is a marvelous
        filtering mechanism, a value judgement of what should be cherished
        versus what just happened to be popular. Billboard #1 hits mean
        nothing if future parents don’t tell their children, “This is good
        music.”</p>
    <p>When records are not replayed, they become fleeting fads in the
        eyes of history. In the case of <b>“Wild Wild West,”</b> the only
        people who understood its importance were those who were there in
        1999, at peak Will Smith. </p>
    <p>But, some songs will survive—the ones most recognized by Gen
        Z.</p>

        top 5 of the Billboard Hot 100, <span>ranked by recognition rate
